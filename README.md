After completing the Udacity FEND course I decided to re-review the section on
JavaScript Programming to refresh my skills, and further commit to memory the
concepts learned. This file serves as a one-stop source for all of my notes

## Technical Information

To run the file on your local machine

1. Download or clone the repository onto your machine.
2. Extract the .zip file.
3. Open javascript_lessons.js file in your Text Editor or favorite JavaScript IDE.
5. I don't recommend you try to run every bit of code in this file at once.  
I found it best to read thru the lessons, and copy/paste code into the console within
Google's Chrome Web Developer Tools.
6. I also included the provided test site files.
